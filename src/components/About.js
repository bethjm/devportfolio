            Collaboration is the foundation of my work ethic. Embracing
            different perspectives while advocating for my ideas has been
            crucial in my previous roles. Thriving in dynamic environments, I've
            always supported a culture that prioritizes collective success. My
            personal training experience has given me essential qualities for
            effective collaboration‚Äîsuch as empathy, adaptability, and a deep
            understanding of individual needs. These traits help me foster
            teamwork and nurture supportive relationships in any group setting.
